# Diabetes Risk Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 100,000 individuals containing demographic, lifestyle, and clinical health information to identify key risk factors associated with diabetes. The goal is to derive actionable insights for prevention, early detection, and intervention strategies.

## Raw Dataset Link
The dataset used in this project can be accessed here: [Dataset.xlsx](./Dataset.xlsx)

## Insight & Findings
1. **Key Risk Factors**: Blood glucose level and HbA1c level are the strongest predictors of diabetes, followed by age, BMI, hypertension, and heart disease.
2. **Prevalence**: Only 8.5% of individuals in the dataset are diagnosed with diabetes, indicating it reflects a general population rather than a clinical one.
3. **Comorbidity**: Individuals with hypertension and heart disease have a higher likelihood of being diabetic.
4. **Demographic Trends**: Higher age and BMI significantly increase diabetes risk, consistent with medical literature.
5. **Smoking History**: Requires further analysis to explore potential influence on diabetes prevalence.

## AI Support Explanation
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, such as data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, can support this project by:
- Identifying hidden patterns and correlations in large datasets.
- Building predictive models to estimate diabetes risk for individuals.
- Enhancing decision-making for healthcare professionals through clinical decision support systems.
- Providing actionable recommendations for prevention and lifestyle interventions.
